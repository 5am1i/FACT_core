# FACT Installation

:exclamation: **Caution: FACT is not intended to be used as public internet service. The GUI is not a hardened WEB-application and it may take your server at risk!**

FACT consists of three components: frontend, database and backend. All components can be installed on one machine as well as on different machines. 
There is an automated installation program supporting Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04 host systems.

## Pre-Install

```sh
$ sudo apt-get install git
$ git clone https://github.com/fkie-cad/FACT_core.git
$ cd FACT_core
$ src/bootstrap/pre_install.sh
```

Modify *src/config/main.cfg* and *src/config/mongod.conf* to suit your needs.
Especially, you should change the mongo passwords.
The database is initialized with these passwords on first start.  
Create the mongo data directory specified in *mongod.conf* and the firmware_file_storage_directory defined in *main.cfg*.
Make sure that the log directory exists as well.

If you have any additional plug-ins, copy/clone them into corresponding *src/plugins/* directory.  

:exclamation: **Reboot before executing the ./install.py** :exclamation:  
:exclamation: **You have to do the above steps before you do anything else** :exclamation:

## Simple One System Setup
:customs: **The installation script installs a lot of dependencies that may have different licenses**
  
After reboot, you can setup an all on one system installation by entering the FACT_core directory and executing:  

```sh
$ ./install.py
```
:beer: **Get a drink... Installation of the dependencies might take some time...** :tea:

For more advanced setups have a look at the help function of the installer:

```sh
$ ./install.py --help
```

## Installation with Nginx
The installer supports automated installation and configuration of nginx.
This will enable a ssl protected access to the frontend via port 443. 
Simply add the *-N* option to activate nginx support.

## Install Statistic Generation Cron Job
FACT provides statistics generated by triggering the *update_statistic* script. The install script can add a cronjob to trigger this script once an hour.
Just add the *-U* option on install.

## Update an older Installation
Checkout the new sources and rerun the installer.
