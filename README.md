# The Firmware Analysis and Comparison Tool (FACT)

The Firmware Analysis and Comparison Tool (formerly known as Fraunhofer's Firmware Analysis Framework (FAF)) is intended to automate most of the firmware analysis process. 
It unpacks arbitrary firmware files and processes several analysis.
Additionally it can compare several images or single files. 

Thereby unpacking, analysis and compares are based on plug-ins guaranteeing maximal flexibility and expandability.

## Requirments
### Hardware
FACT is designed as a multiprocess application, the more Cores and RAM, the better.
#### Minimal
* 4 Cores
* 8GB RAM

#### Recommended
* 16 Cores
* 64GB RAM

### Software
* Ubuntu 16.04
* Python 3.5 or above
* PIP
* git

It is possible to install FACT on any Linux distribution but the installer is limited to Ubuntu 16.04 at the moment.

## Installation

:exclamation: **Caution: FACT is not intended to be used as public internet service. The GUI is not a hardened WEB-application and it may take your server at risk!**

FACT consists of three components: frontend, db and backend. All components can be installed on one machine as well as on different machines. 
There is an automated installation programm supporting Ubuntu 16.04 host systems.

### Pre-Install
Modify *src/config/main.cfg* and *src/config/mongod.conf* to suit your needs.
Especially, you should change the mongo passwords.
The database is initialized with these passwords on first start.  
Create the mongo data directory specified in *mongod.conf* and the firmware_file_storage_directory defined in *main.cfg*.
Make sure that the logging directory exists as well.

If you have any additional plug-ins, copy/clone them into corresponding *src/plugins/* directory.  

:exclamation: **You have to do the above steps before you do anything else** :exclamation:

### Simple One System Setup
:customs: **The installation script installs a lot of dependencies that may have different licenses**
  
To initialize a one system setup simply run:

```sh
$ ./install.py
```

For more advanced setups have a look at the help function of the installer:

```sh
$ ./install.py --help
```

### Installation with Nginx
The installer supports automated installation and configuration of nginx.
This will enable a ssl and password protected access to the frontend via port 443. 
Simply add the *-N* option to activate nginx support.

### Install Statistic Generation Cron Job
FACT provides statistics generated by triggering the *update_statistic* script. The install script can add a cronjob to trigger this script once an hour.
Just add the *-U* option on install.

## Usage
You can start FACT by executing the *start_all_installed_fact_components* scripts.
The script detects all installed components automatically.

```sh
$ ./start_all_installed_fact_components
```

Afterwards FACT can be accesed on <http://localhost:5000> and <https://localhost> (nginx), repspectively.  

You can shutdown the system by pressing *Ctrl + c* or by sending a SIGTERM to the *start_all_installed_faf_components* script.

## Update an older Installation
Checkout the new sources and rerun the installer.
